## Overview

Telescope is a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. It provides an interactive interface for searching files, live grepping text, browsing git commits, and much more. nvim-luffy uses Telescope as the primary search and navigation tool.

<Note>
Telescope uses the FZF native extension for improved performance on large codebases.
</Note>

## Features

- **Fast fuzzy finding** with FZF native integration
- **Live grep** for searching text across your entire project
- **Recent files** access for quick navigation
- **String search** under cursor
- **Todo comments** integration
- **Keymap browser** to discover available shortcuts

## Configuration

Telescope is configured with sensible defaults and custom mappings for improved workflow:

```lua
local telescope = require("telescope")
local actions = require("telescope.actions")

telescope.setup({
  defaults = {
    path_display = { "filename_first" },
    mappings = {
      i = {
        ["<C-k>"] = actions.move_selection_previous, -- move to prev result
        ["<C-j>"] = actions.move_selection_next, -- move to next result
        ["<C-q>"] = actions.send_selected_to_qflist + actions.open_qflist,
      },
    },
  },
  pickers = {
    live_grep = {
      path_display = { "truncate" },
    },
  },
})

telescope.load_extension("fzf")
```

## Keybindings

### Global Keymaps

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="File Navigation">
    | Key | Action | Description |
    | --- | ------ | ----------- |
    | `<leader><leader>` | Find files | Fuzzy find files in current working directory |
    | `<leader>fr` | Recent files | Browse recently opened files |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Text Search">
    | Key | Action | Description |
    | --- | ------ | ----------- |
    | `<leader>/` | Live grep | Search for text across all files in project |
    | `<leader>fc` | Grep string | Find string under cursor in project |
    | `<leader>ft` | Todo search | Search for TODO comments |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Utilities">
    | Key | Action | Description |
    | --- | ------ | ----------- |
    | `<leader>fk` | Keymaps | Browse all available keymaps |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Telescope Window Mappings

These mappings work when you're inside a Telescope picker:

| Mode | Key | Action |
| ---- | --- | ------ |
| Insert | `<C-j>` | Move to next result |
| Insert | `<C-k>` | Move to previous result |
| Insert | `<C-q>` | Send selected items to quickfix list |

## Usage Examples

### Finding Files

1. Press `<leader><leader>` to open the file finder
2. Start typing part of a filename
3. Use `<C-j>` and `<C-k>` to navigate results
4. Press `<Enter>` to open the file

<Tip>
You don't need to type the exact path - Telescope's fuzzy matching will find files even if you skip directories. For example, typing `ucfg` might match `lua/user/config.lua`.
</Tip>

### Searching Text

**Live Grep Search:**

1. Press `<leader>/` to open live grep
2. Type your search pattern
3. Results update in real-time as you type
4. Navigate and open files containing matches

**Search Word Under Cursor:**

1. Place cursor on a word or variable
2. Press `<leader>fc`
3. See all occurrences across your project

<Note>
Live grep is especially powerful for refactoring - use it to find all usages of a function or variable before making changes.
</Note>

### Working with TODO Comments

1. Press `<leader>ft` to open TODO search
2. See all TODO, HACK, WARN, PERF, NOTE comments
3. Jump directly to any todo item

### Discovering Keymaps

Not sure what keybindings are available?

1. Press `<leader>fk` to open keymap browser
2. Search for any keymap
3. See descriptions and associated commands

## Dependencies

Telescope requires several dependencies for full functionality:

```lua
dependencies = {
  "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
  { "nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim", build = "make" },
  "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
  "folke/todo-comments.nvim",
}
```

- **plenary.nvim**: Lua utility library (required)
- **telescope-fzf-native.nvim**: FZF algorithm for faster searching
- **nvim-web-devicons**: File icons in results
- **todo-comments.nvim**: TODO comment integration
