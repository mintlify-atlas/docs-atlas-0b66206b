## Overview

Nvim Tree is a file explorer for Neovim that provides a tree-like view of your project's file system. It features Git integration, file operations, and intuitive navigation. In nvim-luffy, it's configured to appear on the right side of the screen with custom keybindings.

<Note>
Nvim Tree replaces the default netrw file explorer for better performance and features.
</Note>

## Features

- **Tree-based file navigation** with collapsible folders
- **Git status integration** showing modified, staged, and untracked files
- **File operations** (create, delete, rename, copy)
- **Relative line numbers** for quick navigation
- **Custom width** optimized for viewing file paths
- **Icon support** with folder arrows and file type icons

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

```lua
local nvimtree = require("nvim-tree")

-- Disable netrw (Neovim's default file explorer)
vim.g.loaded_netrw = 1
vim.g.loaded_netrwPlugin = 1

nvimtree.setup({
  on_attach = on_attach,
  view = {
    width = 50,
    relativenumber = true,
    side = "right",
  },
  renderer = {
    indent_markers = {
      enable = true,
    },
    icons = {
      glyphs = {
        folder = {
          arrow_closed = "",
          arrow_open = "",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  actions = {
    open_file = {
      window_picker = {
        enable = false,
      },
    },
  },
  filters = {
    custom = { ".DS_Store" },
  },
  git = {
    ignore = false,
  },
})
```

### Custom Key Mappings

Nvim Tree uses a custom `on_attach` function to define buffer-local keymaps:

```lua
local function on_attach(bufnr)
  local api = require("nvim-tree.api")
  local function opts(desc)
    return { 
      desc = "nvim-tree: " .. desc, 
      buffer = bufnr, 
      noremap = true, 
      silent = true, 
      nowait = true 
    }
  end

  -- Load default mappings
  api.config.mappings.default_on_attach(bufnr)

  -- Custom mappings
  vim.keymap.set("n", "l", api.node.open.edit, opts("Open"))
  vim.keymap.set("n", "h", api.node.navigate.parent_close, opts("Close Directory"))
end
```

## Keybindings

### Toggle File Explorer

| Key | Action | Description |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| `<leader>e` | Toggle explorer | Open/close file explorer and focus on current file |

<Tip>
The command `NvimTreeFindFileToggle` will not only toggle the tree but also locate and highlight the current file in the tree structure.
</Tip>

### Navigation Inside Nvim Tree

    | `o` | Open | Same as `<CR>` |
    | `a` | Create | Create new file or folder |
    | `d` | Delete | Delete file or folder |
    | `r` | Rename | Rename file or folder |
    | `x` | Cut | Cut file/folder for moving |

    | `j` / `k` | Move | Navigate up/down |
    | `gg` / `G` | Jump | Go to first/last item |
    | `{number}j` | Jump | Jump down N lines (with relative numbers) |
    | `{number}k` | Jump | Jump up N lines (with relative numbers) |
    | `-` | Parent | Navigate to parent directory |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage Examples

### Basic Navigation

1. Press `<leader>e` to open the file explorer
2. The current file will be highlighted in the tree
3. Use `j` and `k` to move up and down
4. Press `l` to open a file or expand a folder
5. Press `h` to collapse a folder

### Creating New Files

1. Open Nvim Tree with `<leader>e`
2. Navigate to the desired directory
3. Press `a` to create a new file
4. Type the filename and press `<Enter>`
5. Add `/` at the end to create a folder instead

<Tip>
You can create nested directories in one go: type `foo/bar/baz.lua` to create the full path structure.
</Tip>

### File Operations

**Moving Files:**

1. Navigate to the file you want to move
2. Press `x` to cut the file
3. Navigate to destination folder
4. Press `p` to paste

**Copying Files:**

1. Navigate to the file you want to copy
2. Press `c` to copy
3. Navigate to destination
4. Press `p` to paste

**Renaming Files:**

1. Navigate to the file
2. Press `r` to rename
3. Edit the name and press `<Enter>`

### Git Integration

Nvim Tree automatically shows Git status with visual indicators:

- **✓** - Staged file
- **✗** - Deleted file  
- **★** - Renamed file
- **●** - Modified file
- **?** - Untracked file

<Note>
The configuration sets `git.ignore = false`, which means gitignored files are still visible in the tree. This is useful when you need to access configuration files like `.env.example`.
</Note>

### Working with Large Projects

With relative line numbers enabled, you can jump quickly:

1. Look at the relative number of your target file
2. Type `{number}j` or `{number}k` to jump
3. Example: `15j` to jump 15 lines down

## Special Features

### Window Picker Disabled

The configuration disables window picker when opening files:

```lua
actions = {
  open_file = {
    window_picker = {
      enable = false,
    },
  },
}
```

This means files open in the last active window instead of prompting you to choose a window.

### Hidden Files

By default, Nvim Tree filters out `.DS_Store` files:

```lua
filters = {
  custom = { ".DS_Store" },
}
```

These macOS system files won't clutter your tree view.

## Dependencies

```lua
dependencies = "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons"
```

- **nvim-web-devicons**: Provides file type icons in the tree view
