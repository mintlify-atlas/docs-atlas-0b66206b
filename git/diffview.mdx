# Diffview

Diffview is a powerful plugin that provides a single tabpage interface for cycling through diffs for all modified files in your repository. It offers enhanced diff viewing with side-by-side layouts, file trees, and advanced merge conflict resolution.

## Features

- **Side-by-Side Diffs**: View changes in a clear, two-panel layout
- **File Tree Navigation**: Browse all modified files with a tree view
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Powerful 3-way merge interface
- **Branch Comparison**: Compare any two branches or commits
- **File History**: View the complete history of any file
- **Multiple Layout Options**: Vertical splits, horizontal splits, or unified diffs

## Installation

Diffview is configured in `~/workspace/source/lua/leyland/plugins/diffview.lua:1`.

```lua
return {
  "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
  cmd = { "DiffviewOpen", "DiffviewClose", "DiffviewToggleFiles", "DiffviewFocusFiles" },
  keys = {
    { "<leader>dd", "<cmd>DiffviewOpen<cr>", desc = "Open diff view" },
    { "<leader>df", "<cmd>DiffviewClose<cr>", desc = "Close diff view" },
    { "<leader>ds", "<cmd>:DiffviewOpen origin/main...HEAD<cr>", desc = "Open branch diff view" },
  },
}
```

## Configuration

The plugin is configured with lazy loading:

- **Command Lazy Loading**: Only loads when you execute a Diffview command
- **Quick Access**: Keybindings for common diff operations
- **Branch Comparison**: Built-in shortcut for comparing your branch with main

<Note>
  Diffview integrates seamlessly with Neogit, enhancing the diff viewing experience.

## Keybindings

### Global Keybindings

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `<leader>dd` | `:DiffviewOpen` | Open diff view for current changes |
| `<leader>df` | `:DiffviewClose` | Close the active diff view |
| `<leader>ds` | `:DiffviewOpen origin/main...HEAD` | Compare current branch with origin/main |

### Inside Diffview

Once Diffview is open, use these keybindings:

#### File Panel

- `j/k` - Navigate down/up through files
- `<CR>` or `<Tab>` - Open the selected file in diff view
- `<leader>e` - Toggle the file panel
- `g<C-x>` - Open file in horizontal split
- `g<C-v>` - Open file in vertical split
- `g<C-t>` - Open file in new tab
- `R` - Refresh files and diff
- `[x` - Go to previous conflict
- `]x` - Go to next conflict

#### Diff View

- `]c` - Jump to next change
- `[c` - Jump to previous change
- `<leader>co` - Choose OURS (current branch) in conflict
- `<leader>ct` - Choose THEIRS (incoming branch) in conflict
- `<leader>cb` - Choose BASE in conflict
- `<leader>ca` - Choose ALL (both changes) in conflict
- `dx` - Delete the conflict region

## Usage

### Viewing Uncommitted Changes

<Steps>

### Open Diffview

Press `<leader>dd` to open a diff view of all your uncommitted changes.

### Navigate Files

Use `j/k` in the file panel to navigate through modified files.

### Review Changes

Press `<CR>` on a file to view its diff in the main panel.

### Close When Done

Press `<leader>df` to close the diff view.

</Steps>

### Comparing Branches

<Steps>

### Quick Branch Compare

Press `<leader>ds` to compare your current branch with `origin/main`.

### Custom Branch Compare

Use `:DiffviewOpen branch1...branch2` to compare any two branches.

### Review Differences

Navigate through files to see all changes between the branches.

</Steps>

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

<Steps>

### Open Conflict View

After a merge conflict, run `:DiffviewOpen` to see the 3-way merge interface.

### Navigate Conflicts

Use `]x` and `[x` to jump between conflict markers in different files.

### Choose Resolution

Use the conflict resolution keybindings:
- `<leader>co` - Accept current branch changes (OURS)
- `<leader>ct` - Accept incoming branch changes (THEIRS)
- `<leader>cb` - Accept base version
- `<leader>ca` - Keep both changes

### Save and Close

Save the file (`:w`) and close the diff view when all conflicts are resolved.

</Steps>

## Commands

### DiffviewOpen

Open a new diffview.

```vim
:DiffviewOpen [options]
```

#### Examples

```vim
" View uncommitted changes
:DiffviewOpen

" Compare with a specific commit
:DiffviewOpen HEAD~2

" Compare two commits
:DiffviewOpen abc123..def456

" Compare branches (changes in current branch not in main)
:DiffviewOpen origin/main...HEAD

" Compare with a specific branch
:DiffviewOpen feature/new-feature

" View changes in a specific commit
:DiffviewOpen abc123^!
```

<Tip>
  Use `...` (three dots) for branch comparison to see only commits in your branch: `main...feature`
  
  Use `..` (two dots) to see all differences between branches: `main..feature`
</Tip>

### DiffviewClose

Close the current diffview.

```vim
:DiffviewClose
```

### DiffviewToggleFiles

Toggle the file panel visibility.

```vim
:DiffviewToggleFiles
```

### DiffviewFocusFiles

Focus the file panel.

```vim
:DiffviewFocusFiles
```

### DiffviewFileHistory

Open the file history view.

```vim
" View history of current file
:DiffviewFileHistory %

" View history of specific file
:DiffviewFileHistory path/to/file.lua

" View history of current branch
:DiffviewFileHistory
```

## Advanced Usage

### Reviewing Pull Request Changes

```vim
" Fetch the PR branch
:!git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123

" Compare with your main branch
:DiffviewOpen main...pr-123
```

### Finding When a Bug Was Introduced

<Steps>

### Open File History

```vim
:DiffviewFileHistory path/to/buggy/file.lua
```

### Navigate Commits

Use `j/k` to browse through commits in the file panel.

### View Each Commit

Press `<CR>` on each commit to see what changed.

### Identify the Culprit

Find the commit that introduced the problematic code.

</Steps>

### Staging Changes Selectively

While Diffview is primarily for viewing, you can use it with Neogit:

<Steps>

### Open Neogit

Press `<leader>gg` to open Neogit.

### View Diff

Press `d` on a file to open it in Diffview.

### Review Changes

Use Diffview's interface to thoroughly review changes.

### Stage in Neogit

Return to Neogit and stage the files you've reviewed.

</Steps>

## Layout Options

Diffview offers multiple layout configurations:

### Side-by-Side (Default)

Two vertical panels showing before and after versions.

### Unified Diff

Single panel with inline diff markers (similar to `git diff`).

### 3-Way Merge

For merge conflicts: shows OURS, BASE, THEIRS, and RESULT in four panels.

## Tips

<Tip>
  Use `<leader>ds` regularly to review all changes in your feature branch before creating a pull request.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  The `origin/main...HEAD` syntax shows only commits in your current branch that aren't in main, making it perfect for reviewing your feature work.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  When resolving conflicts, review the BASE version (`<leader>cb`) to understand what the code looked like before both changes.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Diffview works with any Git repository and respects your Git configuration.
</Note>

<Tip>
  You can open multiple Diffview tabs to compare different sets of commits simultaneously.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Diffview Not Showing Changes

Make sure you're in a Git repository and have uncommitted changes or specify a valid Git revision range.

### Performance with Large Diffs

For repositories with many changed files, Diffview may take a moment to load. Consider viewing specific files:

```vim
:DiffviewOpen -- path/to/specific/file.lua
```

### Merge Conflict Not Showing 3-Way View

Ensure you're running `:DiffviewOpen` during an active merge (after `git merge` has reported conflicts).
