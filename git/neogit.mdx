# Neogit

Neogit is a magit-inspired Git client for Neovim that provides a powerful, keyboard-driven interface for Git operations. It offers an intuitive staging interface and integrates seamlessly with other Git tools.

## Features

- **Interactive Staging**: Stage/unstage files, hunks, or individual lines with simple keybindings
- **Git Operations**: Commit, push, pull, fetch, rebase, merge, and more - all from one interface
- **Commit History**: Browse and interact with your repository's commit history
- **Diff Integration**: Works with Diffview.nvim for enhanced diff viewing
- **Fuzzy Finder Support**: Integrates with Telescope, fzf-lua, or mini.pick
- **Floating or Split Windows**: Choose your preferred layout

## Installation

Neogit is configured in `~/workspace/source/lua/leyland/plugins/neogit.lua:1`.

```lua
return {
  "NeogitOrg/neogit",
  lazy = true,
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",        -- required
    "sindrets/diffview.nvim",       -- optional - Diff integration
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- optional
    "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",             -- optional
    "nvim-mini/mini.pick",          -- optional
    "folke/snacks.nvim",            -- optional
  },
  cmd = "Neogit",
  keys = {
    {
      "<leader>gg",
      function()
        require("neogit").open({ kind = "floating" })
      end,
      desc = "Neogit (floating)",
    },
  },
}
```

### Dependencies

<Note>
  **Required**: `plenary.nvim` is the only required dependency.
  
  **Optional**: Diffview, Telescope, fzf-lua, mini.pick, and snacks.nvim enhance Neogit's functionality but aren't necessary.
</Note>

## Configuration

The plugin is set up with lazy loading:

- **Lazy Loading**: Loads only when the `:Neogit` command is executed or `<leader>gg` is pressed
- **Floating Window**: Opens in a centered floating window for a clean, focused interface
- **Diffview Integration**: Automatically integrates with Diffview when available

## Keybindings

### Opening Neogit

| Keybinding | Action | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `<leader>gg` | Open Neogit | Opens Neogit in a floating window |

<Tip>
  Press `<leader>gg` from anywhere in Neovim to quickly access Git operations.

  - `u` - Push to upstream
- `F` - Open pull menu
  - `p` - Pull from remote

</Step>

<Step title="Other Operations">

- `d` - Open diff view for item under cursor
- `?` - Show help/keybindings
- `q` - Close Neogit
- `<Esc>` - Go back/close panels
- `r` - Refresh the status

</Step>

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

<Steps>

<Step title="Open Neogit">

Press `<leader>gg` to open the Git interface.

</Step>

<Step title="Stage Changes">

Navigate to modified files and press `s` to stage them. Use `<leader>t` to expand files and stage individual hunks.

</Step>

<Step title="Commit">

Press `c` then `c` to create a commit. Write your commit message and press `<CR>` to confirm.

</Step>

<Step title="Push Changes">

Press `p` then `p` to push your commits to the remote repository.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Example Scenarios

#### Staging Specific Hunks

```plaintext
1. Press <leader>gg to open Neogit
2. Navigate to a modified file
3. Press <Tab> to expand and see hunks
4. Navigate to the hunk you want to stage
5. Press 's' to stage just that hunk
6. Repeat for other hunks as needed
```

#### Interactive Rebase

```plaintext
1. Open Neogit with <leader>gg
2. Press 'r' for rebase menu
3. Select 'i' for interactive rebase
4. Choose the base commit
5. Edit the rebase todo list
6. Save and exit to start the rebase
```

#### Amending the Last Commit

```plaintext
1. Stage your additional changes
2. Open Neogit with <leader>gg
3. Press 'c' then 'a' to amend
4. Edit the commit message if needed
5. Confirm with <CR>
```

## Advanced Features

### Fuzzy Finder Integration

Neogit integrates with your preferred fuzzy finder:

- **Telescope**: Browse commits, branches, and remotes
- **fzf-lua**: Fast, efficient searching through Git objects
- **mini.pick**: Lightweight picking interface

### Diffview Integration

When Diffview is available, pressing `d` on any item opens an enhanced diff view with:

- Side-by-side or unified diff layouts
- File tree navigation
- Merge conflict resolution

See [Diffview documentation](diffview) for more details.

## Tips

<Tip>
  Use `?` inside Neogit to see all available keybindings for the current context.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  You can stage individual lines by entering visual mode (`V`), selecting lines, and pressing `s`.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  The floating window keeps your workspace clean. If you prefer a split layout, you can configure Neogit to use `kind = "split"` or `kind = "tab"`.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Neogit automatically refreshes when you make changes in other buffers, keeping the Git status up to date.
